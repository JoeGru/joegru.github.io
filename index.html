                Biography</h3>
            <p style="background-color:lightsteelblue;margin: 70px;">The oldest available sources disagree as to where
                Sun Tzu was born. The Spring and Autumn Annals and Sima Qian's later Records of the Grand Historian
                (Shiji) state that Sun Tzu was born in Qi. Both sources also agree that Sun Tzu was born in the late
                Spring and Autumn period and that he was active as a general and strategist, serving King Helü of Wu in
                the late sixth century BC, beginning around 512 BC. Sun Tzu's victories then inspired him to write The
                Art of War. The Art of War was one of the most widely read military treatises in the subsequent Warring
                States period, a time of constant war among seven ancient Chinese states – Zhao, Qi, Qin, Chu, Han, Wei,
                and Yan – who fought to control the vast expanse of fertile territory in Eastern China</p>

                The art of war</h3>
            <p style="background-color:lightsteelblue;margin: 70px;"> The masterpiece that made this warlord famous. It
                presents a philosophy of war for managing conflicts and winning battles. It is accepted as a masterpiece
                on strategy and has been frequently cited and referred to by generals and theorists since it was first
                published, translated, and distributed internationally.There are numerous theories concerning when the
                text was completed and concerning the identity of the author or authors, but archeological recoveries
                show The Art of War had taken roughly its current form by at least the early Han. Because it is
                impossible to prove definitively when the Art of War was completed before this date, the differing
                theories concerning the work's author or authors and date of completion are unlikely to be completely
                resolved. Some modern scholars believe that it contains not only the thoughts of its original author but
                also commentary and clarifications from later military theorists, such as Li Quan and Du Mu. </p>

                The legacy left behind</h3>
            <p style="background-color:lightsteelblue;margin: 70px;"> Sun Tzu's Art of War has influenced many notable
                figures. The Chinese historian Sima Qian recounted that China's first historical emperor, Qin's Shi
                Huangdi, considered the book invaluable in ending the time of the Warring States. In the 20th century,
                the Chinese Communist leader Mao Zedong partially credited his 1949 victory over Chiang Kai-shek and the
                Kuomintang to The Art of War. The work strongly influenced Mao's writings about guerrilla warfare, which
                further influenced communist insurgencies around the world.[32]The Art of War was introduced into Japan
                c. AD 760 and the book quickly became popular among Japanese generals. Through its later influence on
                Oda Nobunaga, Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and Tokugawa Ieyasu, it significantly affected the unification of
                Japan in the early modern era. Before the Meiji Restoration, mastery of its teachings was honored among
                the samurai and its teachings were both exhorted and exemplified by influential daimyōs and shōguns. It
                remained popular among the Imperial Japanese armed forces. The Admiral of the Fleet Tōgō Heihachirō, who
                led Japan's forces to victory in the Russo-Japanese War, was an avid reader of Sun Tzu.</p>
